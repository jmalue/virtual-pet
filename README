Created a virtual pet class and virtual pet app
virtual pet app referenced the virtual pet class, which contained the tick() method,
the 3 instance variables and the 3 methods.

In the virtual pet app I attempted unsuccessfully to implement a game loop. 
I was successful in asking for user inputs and generating outputs based on the inputs.
